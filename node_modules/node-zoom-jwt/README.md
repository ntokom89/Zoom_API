## **node-zoom-jwt**


This package makes it simple to use **Zoom's JSON Web Token** functions with **Node JS**.
To use node-zoom-jwt you will need your [APIKey & APISecret](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/build/jwt-app)

Start by installing the node-zoom-jwt package:

> npm i node-zoom-jwt

Add node-zoom-jwt to your file:

```
const Zoom = require("node-zoom-jwt")
```
Use your APIKey & APISecret to connect to your app: 
```
Zoom.connect(
APIKey,
APISecret,
new Date().getTime() + 5000
)
``` 
*The third argument is an expiration for the token. It is highly recommended to set the exp timestamp for a short period, i.e. a matter of seconds. By Default, this value is 5 seconds.*

Now you can access the functions provided by Zoom's API through the Zoom object:
```
const meeting = await Zoom.getMeetingInfo(meetingId)
``` 

*Visit the [Zoom Marketplace Docs](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/introduction) for details on what requests are available and their optional arguments.*
